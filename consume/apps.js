// The index of apps.
//
// A publisher registers their app's manifest into a system namespace `apps`, keyed
// `apps:<0xwallet>:<appName>` — so the registry of apps IS a quickbeam namespace
// like any other, baked into a view like any other, and reading it needs exactly
// one primitive the consumer already has: fetch a view's rows.
//
// That is the whole seam. The publisher half needs fangorn (commit, pin, bake);
// the consumer half needs quickbeam and nothing else. This file is the top of the
// consumer's navigation: apps → domains → rows, each level one HTTP GET against a
// worker, no relay on the read path except to learn WHICH registry to read.
//
// ponytail: one flat list, no pagination and no ranking. Two apps today. When the
// registry is big enough to hurt, rank it the way search.js ranks domains — the
// registry is a baked domain, so it has coverage centroids too.
